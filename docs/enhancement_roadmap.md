6. Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
7. Add performance benchmarks for before/after comparison

## SPECIFIC CODE PATTERNS TO IMPLEMENT

```python
# Example: Advanced LangGraph checkpoint usage
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver

# Example: MCP resource definition
@mcp.resource("research://history/{query_id}")
async def get_research_history(query_id: str) -> Dict:
    # Implementation

# Example: Human-in-the-loop interrupt
.add_node("review_findings", review_node, interrupt_before=True)

# Example: Streaming with progress
async for event in graph.astream_events(state, version="v2"):
    if event["event"] == "on_tool_start":
        # Show progress
```

Focus on creating a production-ready system with enterprise-grade reliability, comprehensive error handling, and exceptional user experience. Each enhancement should be backward compatible and thoroughly tested.
